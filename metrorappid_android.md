Submitted by: [Luqmaan Dawoodjee](https://github.com/luqmaan) [Seth Gholson](https://github.com/sethgho)


### Who will benefit the most from this project?

Austinites who use public transportation and have Android devices.


### What is the problem you are trying to solve by participating in the hackathon?

The CapMetro app takes a lot of work to use to find real-time arrivals for routes like MetroRapid and MetroRail. There is an (iOS app)[https://github.com/luqmaan/MetroRappid] that solves this, but not one for Android.


### What evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) do you have that this is a need?

We use public transportation in Austin.
The success of the iOS MetroRappid app.


### What resources will you be providing to support the development team?

We are the development team.


### List current solutions and why you need a new approach to be developed:

- The CapMetro app, but it is difficult to use
- Google Maps, but it doesn't have real-time data
- Transit apps, like TransitTimes or Transit App, but they don't have real-time data


### At the end of the weekend, what does success look like? What are your expected outcomes?

The source code to a usable version of the MetroRappid app is available on GitHub. If time permits, we'd also like to start the Play Store submission process.
