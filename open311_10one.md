# Open311 vs. 10-One District Map

Submitted by: [Mateo Clarke](https://github.com/mateoclarke)


### Who will benefit the most from this project?

City residents who want to visualize what city services are being requested in their area will have a tool to interpret themes in the 311 data based on their geography. Requests that are systemic and may require city resources could be addressed by the City Council via their district representative.


### What is the problem you are trying to solve by participating in the hackathon?

With the new 10-One model for geographic representation in the Austin City Hall, there are many new faces emerging for possible City Council candidacies.

With geographic representation, Austin residents will have the opportunity to voice concerns about city services to a City Council Member who is actually from their part of the city.

Residents will be able to see what 311 service requests are most common in their geographic district.

City Council Candidates will be able to connect with constituents on daily concerns in their neighborhoods.


### What evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) do you have that this is a need?

This project would serve as a quantitative compliment to the type of qualitative journalism underway on this issue at KUT: [What's the One Thing That Would Make Life On Your Block Better?](http://kut.org/post/austin-whats-one-thing-would-make-life-your-block-better)


### What resources will you be providing to support the development team?

10-One district maps and 311 data are available through the [City of Austin Data Portal](data.ausintexas.gov).

* (10-One District Maps) <http://www.austintexas.gov/GIS/CouncilDistrictMap/>
* (311 Data Map) <https://data.austintexas.gov/Government/311-Public-Data-Mapped/wstj-t8me>
* (District Shapefiles overlayed on GoogleMaps) <https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col22+from+1Y-czAsm_zta9tLqOSu6HCvVVret27tZ_GeNSiQI&viz=MAP&h=false&lat=30.304944173284486&lng=-97.72679119042965&t=1&z=11&l=col22&y=2&tmplt=2&hml=KML>
* (KUT News Story for Context) <http://kut.org/post/map-10-1-map-books-austin-concludes-redistricting-update>

### List current solutions and why you need a new approach to be developed:

The closest solution that exists today is this [311 Data Map](https://data.austintexas.gov/Government/311-Public-Data-Mapped/wstj-t8me) accessible through the City of Austin Data Portal. It lacks interactive with the 10-One Map. Better analyze and trends could be provided aside from strictly the maps.


### At the end of the weekend, what does success look like? What are your expected outcomes?

* A tool that plots 311 data on the City of Austin Map with District Map shapefiles.
* Visualizations that compare 311 request types between the 10 different districts.
