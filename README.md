# Hackathon Ideas

This repository contains community-curated civic project ideas for [ATX Hack for Change 2014](http://atxhackforchange.org/).

The ideas listed here have _not_ yet been submitted as project proposals to the event. We need your help to refine these ideas, and then to identify a _project champion_ who can submit it as a proposal.

Please respond by Fri, May 16, 2014 with your feedback.

The ideas are presented as individual files in this directory, which you can browse. If you [browse these files online](https://github.com/open-austin/hackathon-ideas/), _github_ will display them nicely formatted.

*If you want to participate in any of these projects*, it is important that you [register to attend the hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/atx-hack-for-change-registration-10082365627?aff=website).

Collected ideas:
* [Civic FU](civic_fu.md)
* [Google Community Connections Dataset and Visualization Tool](google_community_connections.md)
* [Open311 vs. 10-One District Map](open311_10one.md)
* [Pet Finder](pet_finder.md)
* [Creating How-To Content for Citizen Data Analysts](writing_data_how_tos.md)

## How to contribute an idea.

If you have a _github_ account, then:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Copy the TEMPLATE.md file to a new file, called something like "project_name.md".
1. Change the title at the top of the page to the project name.
1. Fill out the questionnaire.

If you do not have (and do not want) a _github_ account then you could just [download the template](http:TEMPLATE.md), fill it out with a text editor, and [send it via email](mailto:hack@open-austin.org).

Stuff to know:
* The file is formatted in _Markdown_ style. Help [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Also, a nice, free and accessible markdown text editor to help you learn is called [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) _(OSX only, sorry)_.
* Helpful information about hackathon project ideas [here](http://atxhackforchange.org/projects/).
* The careful observer may note that the template is based on the project submission form for the hackathon.

## How to provide feedback for an idea.

You will need a _github_ account to participate in the discussion.

Use the _github_ "Issues" feature to discuss an idea. Click "Issues" in the sidebar, check whether there already is an issue opened for the project and discussion point you wish to make.

If not, click "Create a new issue", and submit your feedback.

## How to support an idea.

You will need a _github_ account to express your support.

In this context, support means you're potentially interested in working on this project at the hackathon.

Use the _github_ "Issues" feature to express your support for an idea. Click "Issues" in the sidebar, and check whether there is an issue already open to express your support for the project. If so, add your comment of support. If not, "create a new issue" and indicate your support for the project.
