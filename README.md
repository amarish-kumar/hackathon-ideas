# Hackathon Ideas

This repository contains community-curated civic project ideas for [ATX Hack for Change 2014](http://atxhackforchange.org/).

The ideas listed here have _not_ yet been submitted as project proposals to the event. We need your help to refine these ideas, and then to identify a _project champion_ who can submit it as a proposal. (The hackathon project proposals that have been submitted are [here](http://atxhackforchange.org/project-list/).)

Please respond by Fri, May 16, 2014 with your feedback.

The ideas are presented as individual files in this directory, which you can browse. If you [browse these files online](https://github.com/open-austin/hackathon-ideas/), _github_ will display them nicely formatted.

*If you want to participate in any of these projects*, it is important that you [register to attend the hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/atx-hack-for-change-registration-10082365627?aff=website).

## How to contribute an idea.

If you have a _github_ account, then:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Copy the TEMPLATE.md file to a new file, called something like "project_name.md".
1. Change the title at the top of the page to the project name.
1. Fill out the questionnaire.

If you do not have (and do not want) a _github_ account then you could just [download the template](http:TEMPLATE.md), fill it out with a text editor, and [send it via email](mailto:hack@open-austin.org).

Stuff to know:
* The file is formatted in _Markdown_ style. Help [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Also, a nice, free and accessible markdown text editor to help you learn is called [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) _(OSX only, sorry)_.
* Helpful information about hackathon project ideas [here](http://atxhackforchange.org/projects/).
* The careful observer may note that the template is based on the project submission form for the hackathon.
